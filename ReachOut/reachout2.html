<h3 class="discussion">DITCHING WHO YOU ARE FOR WHO YOU CAN BECOME</h3>
<span class="big-letter">O</span>ne of the most important teachings in Christianity is that we should focus on who we can become. Jesus teaches us that we must abandon our old selves to unlock our full potential as a Christian.
In this Christian perspective, abandoning self-centeredness is not only something every person should do, it is also the only way to find real peace and fulfillment in life.
<p>Every person has a higher self and a lower self. The lower self is what we're all about: money, fame, power, ego. The higher self is pure energy that exists inside of us, hidden from the world. This essay will explore the benefits of realizing your full potential and unlocking your full potential by abandoning sin and becoming who you are meant to be.</p>
We can change who we are by improving ourselves, We can become more than we could ever imagine if we work hard enough</p>
Contrary to popular belief, the concept of becoming a better person is not always about improving in what you are already good at. It is much more than that. It is about giving up who you are as a person and instead becoming who you can become.
    This is where the idea of <b>Higher Self</b> comes into play. In this view, a human being can never become perfect without first abandoning all sin, including their own imperfections and limitations.
    It's only after we've distanced ourselves from our previous selves that we can "unlock our full potential" and become something new - something better.</p>
